## Whats being done:

### A) Code1.py
Status -> working  
Issues/drawbacks:
1) Spacing between words in normal text not taken care of
2) Limitation in switching between upper case and lower case and vice versa
3) Sometimes inaccurate when converting from normal text to cipher text and then back to normal text
4) Normal text limited to only alphabets 

### B) Code2.py
Status -> Still working on it  
Whats done so far:
1) Display NxN matrix for all permutations of the encrpytion/decrpytion matrix 
2) Spacing issue taken care of  

Improvements that im working on:
1) Will 'try' and implement it on all alphabets, numbers and special characters
